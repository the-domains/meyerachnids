Brachypelma Vagans

by Caelan Meyer

The Brachypelma Vagans is a species of tarantula ademic to Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, and Yucatan. The predominantly live in Mexico. Other names that also refer to Brachypelma Vagans are Black Velvet tarantula, the Mexican red rump. These very large arachnids like to live in forested areas and scrublands. These tarantulas are terrestrial tarantulas, meaning that like so burrow and generally stay close to the ground, opposed to arboreal spiders, that live high up in the tree tops.

Activity and habits

The B. Vagans(along with other terrestrial tarantulas) like to spend most of their time in a borrow constructed by the spider itself, or by stealing it from another animal. When the spider finds a suitable burrowing site the spider will excavate and pat down soil to suit its size and burrow comfortability. After the burrow is built the spider will spin a series of silken trip wires around the interior and exterior of the burrow. The triplines alert the spider when any animal regrettably walks onto this system. The spider has eight eyes on top of the carapace(the head) that have very poor vision and only gives a vague idea of its surroundings. To counteract the poor eyesight, the tarantula has very sensitive hairs all over its body that act like a super vibration sensor. If that wasn't enough it also has two extensions at the front of its body called pedipalps that feel and pickup smell given information that the spider uses to detect prey.

Captive housing and diet

The Brachypelma Vagans is a very popular option in the pet trade for any arachnid lover. It's popularity is based on its amazing colors and relatively docile behaviour. As far as care goes the tarantula can be kept in a 10 gallon tank that suplies the spider all the space a tarantula would ever need. To keep the tarantula happy give it 3-4 inches of soft substrate for the animal to burrow. A hide is required so that the tarantula has a place to hide and feels safe. A log or piece of wood make great hides. Keeps your tarantula at a comfortable temperature of 70-80 degrees. In the wild these spiders prey on almost anything smaller than itself that it can sink its massive fangs into.

Stages of life

This species, like most others, starts life by crawling out of a silk covered egg sack. At this very early stage in life this is a very vulnerable time to be a spiderling, so staying hidden is key for survival. When tarantulas are spiderlings they are not very big, so these little tarantulas are often hunted and eaten by other animals, or even other tarantulas. Tarantulas, much like other spiders, have an exoskeleton. Which means that they do not have any internal structuring. So to grow they need to shed old skin then strengthen the new skin. To do this the spider finds a quiet place to go into a state called moulting. When the spider is ready to moult, it pumps blood into cell cavities that separate the old skin from the new. They often lay on their back to make moulting easier. The animal starts to wriggle and squeeze very slowly out of its exoskeleton. The moulting process can take one to twelve hours to complete. After the moult, the spider is very weak and dehydrated and requires rests to gather enough energy to move. It will take several days for the fangs of the tarantula to harden again so that they may hunt and eat. The exoskeleton will fully harden after a week.
